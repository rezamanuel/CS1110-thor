"""
This code is used to prototype some features of the game by Nick Chandler and Reza Mirzaiee
Here is a general run-down of the game we're gonna make:
- top-down hack n slash where you play as thor with a hammer
- throwing the hammer pushes you back + pushes enemies back
- Hold arrow keys to charge hammer
- you can gravitate towards hammer when it is thrown.
- random enemy generation
- damage dealt counter = score
- player is fully animated
- most animations hand-made
- want to incorporate sounds if we have time / engine support
Notes:
    - make thor walk slower with hammer, reduce animation speed.
    - figure out how to add sounds
    - make special attack for when connecting with hammer if space is pressed.
    - more speed = more damage
